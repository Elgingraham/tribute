James Gosling is married and has two children.<br> 

His Net Worth in 2021 is estimated at $20 million U.S.<br>

The title of his thesis was "The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints".<br> 

The Order is Canada's second highest civilian honor. Officers are the second highest grade within the Order.<br>

Java is used in applications as diverse as desktop computing, scientific studies, enterprise applications, web servers, embedded systems, and mobile devices and is widely used in computer science education.<br>

The initial language, called “Oak,” was first demonstrated on September 2, 1992, in the form of a sophisticated handheld media controller, called Star-7, which used a graphical user interface and easy-to-follow “home” metaphor.<br>

He has built satellite data acquisition systems, a multiprocessor version of Unix, several compilers, mail systems and window managers.<br> 

He has also built a WYSIWYG text editor, a constraint based drawing editor and a text editor called `Emacs' for Unix systems. He spent many years as a VP and Fellow at Sun Microsystems. At Sun his early activity was as lead engineer of the NeWS window system.<br> 

When he worked at Liquid Robotics, his main job was helping to make autonomous ocean-going robots used in oceanographic and atmospheric research.<br> 

He is known for his love of proving "the unknown" and has noted that his favorite irrational number is √2. He has a framed picture of the first 1,000 digits of √2 in his office.</p>
